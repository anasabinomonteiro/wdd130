      <p>Hey, guys! ! Let me introduce myself. I'm married to the best man in the world, Doglas! We have two children, Mayara and Benjamin. I'm from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, we have great cuisine here and many, many buildings!</p>  
      <p>I have been a member of the church since 2008 and actually serve the relief society as a second counselor in my ward.</p>
      <p>I have been a systems analyst since 2018, before I worked in the administrative and tax area when I was 16 years old, today I am 42 years old.</p>
      <p>I love dancing, theater, films and series and I have been venturing into the world of IT for 5 years, which has always been my dream!</p>
      <p>Thanks for looking my web page.</p>
