                <p class="pg2">The city scape bridge stretches elegantly across the river, connecting the bustling urban neighborhoods on either side.
                 Its sleek steel arches rise gracefully into the skyline, offering a breathtaking view of the city's iconic landmarks.
                 As day turns to night, the bridge becomes a mesmerizing beacon, illuminated by a symphony of lights that reflect off the water below.
